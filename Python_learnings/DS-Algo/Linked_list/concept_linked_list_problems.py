"""When preparing for tech lead interviews, especially focusing on single linked lists in Python, you'll want to be 
ready for a variety of problems that test both your understanding of data structures and your ability to solve complex 
problems efficiently. Below are some common interview problems related to single linked lists, along with brief explanations 
and what interviewers might be looking for.

### 1. **Reverse a Linked List**
   - **Problem:** Given a singly linked list, reverse the list and return the reversed list.
   - **What to Focus On:** Iterative and recursive approaches, understanding time and space complexity, and edge cases
       (e.g., an empty list or a single-node list).
   - **Example:** [Problem: Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

### 2. **Detect a Cycle in a Linked List**
   - **Problem:** Determine if a linked list has a cycle (a node's next pointer points to a previous node).
   - **What to Focus On:** Use Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare). Understand the space complexity benefits 
       of this approach over using a set.
   - **Example:** [Problem: Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)

### 3. **Find the Middle of a Linked List**
   - **Problem:** Find the middle node of a linked list. If the list has an even number of nodes, return the second middle node.
   - **What to Focus On:** Use the slow and fast pointer technique for an efficient O(n) time complexity solution.
   - **Example:** [Problem: Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)

### 4. **Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists**
   - **Problem:** Given two sorted linked lists, merge them into one sorted linked list.
   - **What to Focus On:** Understanding how to manage pointers between two lists, edge cases, and efficient merging.
   - **Example:** [Problem: Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

### 5. **Remove Nth Node from End of List**
   - **Problem:** Remove the nth node from the end of a linked list in one pass.
   - **What to Focus On:** Use two pointers with a gap of n nodes between them, and handle edge cases such as removing the head node.
   - **Example:** [Problem: Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)

### 6. **Intersection of Two Linked Lists**
   - **Problem:** Find the node at which two singly linked lists intersect.
   - **What to Focus On:** Use two pointers to traverse the lists; consider edge cases where lists do not intersect or are of different lengths.
   - **Example:** [Problem: Intersection of Two Linked Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/)

### 7. **Copy List with Random Pointer**
   - **Problem:** Each node in a linked list has a random pointer in addition to the next pointer. Deep copy this list.
   - **What to Focus On:** Handle the complexities of copying both next and random pointers, consider using a hash map or an interleaving method.
   - **Example:** [Problem: Copy List with Random Pointer](https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/)

### 8. **Reorder List**
   - **Problem:** Reorder a linked list such that the first element is followed by the last, then the second by the second-last, and so on.
   - **What to Focus On:** Break the list into two halves, reverse the second half, and merge them alternately.
   - **Example:** [Problem: Reorder List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/)

### 9. **Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List**
   - **Problem:** Flatten a multilevel doubly linked list where nodes have both next and child pointers.
   - **What to Focus On:** Handling recursive structures and ensuring that all levels are flattened into a single list.
   - **Example:** [Problem: Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-a-multilevel-doubly-linked-list/)

### 10. **Add Two Numbers Represented by Linked Lists**
   - **Problem:** Each linked list represents a number in reverse order. Add these two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
   - **What to Focus On:** Understand digit-by-digit addition, carry management, and handling different lengths of linked lists.
   - **Example:** [Problem: Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)

### Tips for Preparation:
- **Understand Edge Cases:** Always consider edge cases like empty lists, single-node lists, or lists with cycles.
- **Practice Different Approaches:** For some problems, like reversing a list, know both iterative and recursive approaches.
- **Efficiency:** Be aware of the time and space complexity of your solutions, and be prepared to discuss them.
- **Explain Your Thought Process:** During interviews, explain your approach and reasoning clearly. Interviewers are often interested in your problem-solving process as much as the solution.

These problems are commonly asked in tech lead interviews and are a good representation of the type of linked list challenges you might encounter."""
